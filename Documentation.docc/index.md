Color accuracy is an important feature which prevents you from recording washed-out, photocopied-looking time lapses.
</p>


## Features

- **Color Accurate**: What you see is what you get. Never screen record faded videos again[^1]
- **Minimalist Design**: a fully featured web recorder in your menu bar
- **Hardware Accelerated**: fully utilized hardware accelerated encoding for a lightweight recording experience
- **Space Saving**: Avoid the excessive file sizes of high quality video (can be as high as 7 GB / hour).
- **Camera Recording**: Record your webcam or phone with the same frame rate and camera speed
- **Secure**: Use the fully features of `ScreenCaptureKit` to only record certain windows, applications and more. Never leak your bank information in recordings again!
- **Customizability**: Change everything from the frame rate, quality and speed multiple

## Installation

The recommended way to install **TimeLapze** is through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) cask.

```bash
brew install timelapze
```

## Direct Download

If you wish, you can go directly to the [releases page](https://github.com/wkaisertexas/ScreenTimeLapse/releases) and download `TimeLapze.zip`. Both Chrome and Safari give a warning about downloading suspicious files. Ignore then, extract the archive and you should get a `ScreenTimeLapse.app` file. Move that file into your `Applications` directory. 

## Local Development

To develop TimeLapze locally, you will need to clone and open this repository in XCode.

Once that's done, you can use the following commands to run the app locally:

```console
git clone https://github.com/wkaisertexas/ScreenTimeLapse
cd ScreenTimeLapse
open TimeLapze.xcodeproj
```

Following this, you need to allow the app to be built for local signining.

[^1]: [Apple's screen recorder convert's the display's color space](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/inaccurate-colors-from-desktop-recording/m-p/12168181) from **DCI_P3** to **sRGB**. The error is typically subtle, but makes the tool unsuitable for color sensitive work. Color is difficult and even [HDR video have persistent issues with overexposure in screenshots](https://github.com/iina/iina/issues/3866).
